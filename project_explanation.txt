# Mental Health Sentiment Analysis System - Simple Explanation

## What is it?
A system that analyzes text to understand emotional states and mental health indicators using three different AI models.

## How it Works

### 1. Text Processing
- Takes in text (like social media posts, messages, or journal entries)
- Cleans and prepares the text for analysis
- Identifies important words and phrases

### 2. Three Analysis Models

#### Model 1: Basic Analysis (Logistic Regression)
- Quick and simple analysis
- Good for straightforward emotional expressions
- Fast processing
- Example: "I feel happy today" → Positive

#### Model 2: Complex Analysis (SVM)
- Handles more complex emotional expressions
- Better at understanding mixed feelings
- Good with sarcasm and subtle emotions
- Example: "Not sure if I'm happy or just pretending" → Mixed/Complex

#### Model 3: Deep Understanding (Deep Learning)
- Most advanced analysis
- Understands context and relationships
- Best for complex mental health discussions
- Example: Long paragraphs about emotional state → Detailed analysis
